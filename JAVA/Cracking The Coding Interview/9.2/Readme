Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left hand corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there for the robot to go from {0,0} to {X,Y}? FOLLOW UP Imagine certain squares are “off limits”, such that the robot can not step on them. Design an algorithm to to find a path for the robot from top left to bottom right.
